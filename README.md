vue.config.js Key Features Authentication The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The main functionalities related to authentication include:
Login: Users can log in with their email and password, with an option to stay signed in. Logout: Users can log out, which clears the authentication tokens. Token Management: The app handles access and refresh tokens using cookies. Token Expiration Check: Before making API requests, the app checks if the access token is expired. If expired, it attempts to refresh the token. Token Expiration Check The utils/auth.js file contains the isTokenExpired function that checks if a JWT token has expired. This is done by decoding the token and comparing the expiration time with the current time.

javascript Copy code import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode'; // Import the named export

export function isTokenExpired(token) { if (!token) return true; // Consider no token as expired

try { const decodedToken = jwtDecode(token); // Decode the JWT token const currentTime = Date.now() / 1000; // Get current time in seconds

return decodedToken.exp < currentTime; // Return true if token has expired
} catch (error) { return true; // In case of an error, treat token as expired } } Components The application consists of several reusable components:

SideBar: Contains navigation links and a logout button. Login: The login form for user authentication. Profile: Displays user profile information. TimelineView: Shows tasks and projects in a timeline format. Installation Clone the repository. Navigate to the project directory.
